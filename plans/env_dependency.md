## chart to image impl has env dependent impl
## current we did for windows
The reason for this is subtle but critical for how npm works on Windows. While on Linux and macOS, npm creates a direct executable file in the .bin directory, on Windows, it creates a set of command files instead:
c-to-i (a shell script)
c-to-i.cmd (a Windows command script)
c-to-i.ps1 (a PowerShell script)
Our Python os.path.exists() check fails because it's looking for a file named c-to-i, not a command. The shell=True argument in subprocess.run is what allows us to run these .cmd scripts as if they were executables, but we need to point to the correct file.
The Solution
The fix is to explicitly use the .cmd version of the executable in our Python code. This will work reliably on Windows environments.
I will now modify service/chart_service.py to append .cmd to the executable path.
I've adjusted the code to use the correct c-to-i.cmd script for Windows. This should finally resolve the "path not found" error.
Please hit the API endpoint one more time. You should see DEBUG: c-to-i exists? True in the console, followed by the successful generation of the charts. Let me know the outcome

Goal:
we want to include the condition for overdue of any recurring payment.

Expectation:
1. if current date > billing date + due period then it must be tagged as overdue. Tagging must be in similar fashion as used in saving goal status tagging. 
2. this is how the new card should look like "C:\Users\jainn\Downloads\Screenshot 2025-07-21 034935.png". Observe the change in placement of pay button and the new overdue tag.
3. Irrespective of the subscription is overdue, on clicking PAY - a dialog box should open showing the Payment Date to select (today by default), Amount to type (default amount), Next Billing Date (Fixed, as per Existing Billing Date + Billing Period), and a Pay Button.
4. If user makes changes to that payment dialog box on the date or amount then it does not affect the basic recurring-expense details.
